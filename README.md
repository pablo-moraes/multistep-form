## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

Make this project helped me to remember about Vue, cause I haven't studied it for a long time. I've learned about Vue states and composition API although I haven't used it here well.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about composition API and challenge myself to make elaborate projects.

### Useful resources

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - This helped me to understand more about the composition API and event handling.
- [Flex CSS](https://origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) and [Grid CSS](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/css-grid-layout-guia-completo/) - Here you can find a complete guide that can help you clear up some doubts about these CSS layouts.
